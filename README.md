# **Buenro – Initial Product Discovery**

## **Introduction**

Hello Buenro team,

I hope you’re doing well. Thank you for the opportunity to have a conversation with you all and potentially work with your awesome team. I’m genuinely excited because I’m a bit obsessed with social apps, I find it extremely interesting and fascinating how they’re changing the way we connect with people and how they’re continuously evolving.

I’m going to share my thoughts on Buenro’s product journey discovery. I believe product design isn’t just about making things look pretty, it’s about making them work better. It’s about understanding the actual problems, the people, and the context behind their needs, then finding the best way to solve those problems.

Since I haven’t seen the complete Buenro app, just some screens on your website, and I don’t have your detailed research data, I took a simple approach. I shared your main idea about helping people who feel lonely or want to connect, who like to travel in groups or need roommates, finding shared homes with a few of my friends and teammates. Through these quick talks, I tried to see what they think, how they’d want such an app to look, and what would make it actually useful in day-to-day life.

Of course, this might be very different from what you already planned, especially since my circle might not be your exact target group. I also assumed these homes listed on the app are owned by regular users (or hosts) who rent them out, instead of businesses. But I'm hoping this will give you another perspective.

Now, based on these small conversations, I tried mapping out a **high-level journey** of how Buenro could serve people. I’ll share the logic behind my ideas, plus a broader look at how it all might align with the real Buenro website, and highlight the “group thinking” piece that can give a little nudge even unplanned users into discovering new homes or roommates. I hope you find it interesting!

## **Part 1: Casual Conversations – The Idea**

### **The Discussion**

When I talked to my friends and teammates about Buenro’s concept, they all found it interesting. I didn’t tell them if something like this already exists; I just asked if they’d like an app that maybe helps them go through loneliness, meet new people, find roommates, travel buddies, and discover good places to stay. _“How would you want it to work?”_ was my main question.

Overall, they pictured an app that’s **part social media, part dating, part BnB, and part travel app**, basically, a blending of tools they’re used to. Like -

- Some wanted **AI-suggested random profiles** so they could quickly connect with new people when bored or lonely.
- Others wanted to meet new friends or roommates based on common interests and activities.
- The majority, though, kept talking about **groups**: they want to join groups/communities based on their interest, see what’s happening there, and then connect with people from those groups/communities. They also love the idea of a dedicated “Homes” section attached to those groups, so the homes feel relevant (like a “Hiking Lovers” group linking to a cabin or remote lodge).

**Conclusion:** People want to discover or connect differently depending on their situation. Sometimes they prefer letting AI handle it. Other times, they’d rather jump into a specific group or do a direct search. Either way, the underlying theme is **community**, they’re eager to be in a place (virtual or real) where meeting people is organic and fun.

### **Connecting with People**

From the casual research, they basically thought of multiple ways to find and connect with others on Buenro:

1. **AI Suggestions**  
   The app suggests interesting profiles or groups automatically, so they don’t have to do the searching. Perfect for last-minute or some random curiosity.

2. **Search**  
   They can look for certain interests, locations, or even names. People who have exact criteria (like “female roommate in NYC, under $1000/month”) want advanced filters and a manual search approach.

3. **Feed**  
   A casual browsing approach, seeing real-time activities or posts from friends or recommended people. Think “Jane is planning a trip to Bali next month”, if that sparks interest, they can dive in.

4. **Groups**  
   Topic-based or city-based communities (like “Lisbon Nomads,” “Hiking Lovers,” or “Remote Founders Circle”). People love seeing group interactions, because it feels more organic than one-on-one matches.

---

### **Starting Interactions**

In these quick chats, I noticed that a user’s mood or context decides how they initiate contact. For example:

| **Context**                               | **Interaction Point**           | **Reason**                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sudden plan, feeling bored or lonely      | AI Suggestions / “Discover” tab | “No time or specific plan, I need interesting people or events right away. Surprise me with something relevant!” |
| Same scenario but more direct approach    | Search                          | “I know what I want. Let me type it in, like a roommate or a friend in a new city.”                              |
| Regular browsing                          | Feed                            | “I just want to see what’s happening. Maybe I’ll see a friend’s post or a group event that catches my eye.”      |
| Group browsing or interest-specific query | Group                           | “I love X hobby or Y location. Let me see who’s active in that community, check out their vibe, then connect.”   |

## **Part 2: Finding Homes (Plus the “Home Swap” Concept)**

Many also mentioned wanting to see if certain homes fit:

- **Groups of friends**
- **Families**
- **Digital nomads**
- **Pet owners**  
  ...etc.

Basically, they’d like filters that highlight each scenario (like “Pet-friendly,” “Remote worker–friendly,” “Family-friendly”) so it’s easy to find the perfect place. They also want to see if the home has good ratings, if the host is trustworthy, and if it lines up with the vibe of the group or trip (for example, near hiking trails if it’s an outdoors group).

On top of that, there’s a **cool “home swap” idea** that came up:

- Sometimes two homeowners meet on Buenro and realize they want to visit each other’s city. They can do a **direct swap** for a set period, drastically cutting their costs.
- For instance, a homeowner in Berlin who wants to explore Lisbon might swap houses with a homeowner in Lisbon who’s eager to check out Berlin. As long as both parties find the arrangement fair and have shared guidelines (like how utilities or cleaning is handled), they swap each other’s homes for a flexible timeline.
- This not only fosters new experiences but also makes travel more budget-friendly, and can spark deeper connections (“Hey, you’re staying in my home, I’m staying in yours, let’s compare notes!”).

Below is a **quick table** summarizing contexts where people might search for homes (or consider swapping) and how Buenro could help:

| **Context**                     | **Key Preferences**                                                                                | **How the App Helps**                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Moving to a new city for a job  | - Short commute <br> Budget-friendly <br> Safe neighborhood                                        | - **Map-based search** with budget filters <br> Verified listings/ratings                                                                                                               |
| Student looking off-campus      | - Proximity to campus <br> Cheap rent <br> Possibly same-age roommates                           | - **Campus-based group** or filter <br> Mark listings as “student-friendly”                                                                                                             |
| Digital nomad / short-term stay | - Month-to-month lease <br> Reliable Wi-Fi, workspace <br> Social vibe                           | - **Lifestyle tags** (wifi, coworking area) <br> Flexible or short-term lease filters                                                                                                   |
| Local but wants a change        | - Pet-friendly or quiet environment <br> Specific roommate preferences                            | - **Advanced filters** (pets allowed, minimal noise, etc.) <br> “Lifestyle match” profiles                                                                                              |
| Homeowner-to-Homeowner “Swap”   | - Travel cheaper by exchanging homes <br> Trust: verified owners, guidelines for cleaning & usage | - **Swap Feature** in the app: homeowners can match if they want to stay in each other’s properties at overlapping times. <br> Ratings and references to ensure everyone’s comfortable. |

This is just an idea to illustrate how people might approach searching for or <be> swapping <br> homes. They want practical info (rent, location, short-term lease) plus social/lifestyle info (are the roommates chill, do they share my hobbies, is the host verified?), and now an option for direct exchanges if both parties agree.

## **Part 3: How It Aligns with Buenro’s Mission and Platform**

**Buenro’s real vision** (from your website) is **ending loneliness** and creating a space where anyone can find their tribe. It’s about bridging co-living, travel, and social networking. Here’s how these ideas fit:

1. **Roommate Matching**  
   Buenro uses an AI engine to match people with similar vibes, lifestyles, or interests. This resonates with the request for AI suggestions or curated results.

2. **Travel Buddy Finder**  
   Many peers in my talks said they’d love to find travel buddies, Buenro’s “shared trip” or “group travel” concept lines up perfectly with that.

3. **Community & Circles**  
   You mention “Circles” or specialized groups for different communities. That’s exactly what my friends wanted: interest-based or city-based groups that feel welcoming and real. They love seeing group events, group homes, and group trips.

4. **Future Plans Over Past Posts**  
   Buenro focuses on upcoming events or co-living opportunities instead of typical social feeds. This is appealing to people who want a forward-looking approach, like a “What’s next?” mentality. They’d see a feed of potential trips or shared homes to join.

5. **Trust & Verification**  
   Sharing homes or traveling with strangers can be scary. Users definitely want ways to know the host or group is safe, reviews, verification, or mutual connections. Buenro’s approach to verifying hosts and offering “trusted circles” matches that nicely.

6. **Potential for Home Swaps**  
   The addition of a “swap” system fits naturally into Buenro’s community vibe. It’s a _win-win_ for homeowners, if they share enough trust or references, they reduce travel costs and gain a more authentic local experience.

Overall, your platform is more comprehensive than just “find a roommate.” It’s about a **full social and communal experience**. So these casual conversations point to the same direction: people want a place to build in-person connections easily, with minimal friction or fear, and that’s exactly where Buenro stands out.

## **Part 4: Leveraging Group Thinking Psychology**

Some people also admitted they might never have considered finding a new roommate, listing their home, or swapping places, **until** they see how many friends are in a certain group or how popular a certain home is. This taps into the idea of “group thinking” or “herd mentality”:

> “Wow, 300 new connections made in Berlin this month? Maybe I should check out that co-living space too!”

### **Practical Nudges**

1. **Active Communities**  
   Show how many members already joined a certain group or location. If everyone’s raving about the Lisbon digital nomad scene, newcomers might jump in too, even if they had no plan initially.

2. **Social Proof in Profiles and Feeds**  
   If a user sees that three of their friends just moved into a house or joined a trip, it triggers curiosity. _“Maybe I should join, too?”_

3. **Trending Homes**  
   Highlight homes that are quickly getting booked, or big success stories like _“Host X just matched 4 new roommates!”_. It gently encourages a user to consider it even if they were on the fence.

4. **Notifications**  
   Send a friendly notification like, _“Your friend Jade is planning to swap her home in Barcelona, interested in letting her use yours in Berlin while you explore Spain?”_ This small prompt leverages group momentum.

### **Ethical Note**

While “nudging” people can be helpful, it’s important to do it **responsibly**, not by faking popularity or creating unnecessary FOMO. People should feel genuinely informed and excited, never tricked. Nonetheless, used well, this approach can help people discover new living situations or travel experiences they never realized they wanted.

## **Part 5: Concerns & Safety Issues**

One question everyone asked:

> “How do I know a person is safe to live with or swap homes with?”  
> “What if the place isn’t what they claim?”
> “What if I don’t like the people I’m matched with?”

Totally valid worries-sharing personal space can be scary. Here’s how Buenro could help:

1. **Profile Verification**

   - Basic ID checks or some screening.
   - “Verified” badges for those who pass.

2. **Reviews & Ratings**

   - Let guests rate the place and the host.
   - Future users see these scores, so fewer bad surprises.

3. **Mutual Connections or Circles**

   - If you share friends or are in the same group, there’s more trust.
   - People trust recommendations through a community more than random strangers.

4. **Detailed Listings**

   - Encourage real photos, a quick intro video, and house rules.
   - You see exactly what you’re getting—no hidden issues.

5. **Home Swap Guidelines**

   - A simple agreement template for cleaning, damages, etc.
   - Clear expectations reduce headaches.

6. **In-app Communication**
   - Secure chat for clarifying details, or do a video call first.
   - Open talks build trust and make everyone feel safer.

---

## **Part 6: Public Plan Sharing**

What if you share a trip/event publicly? Won’t that risk stalkers or privacy breaches? Not everyone wants to broadcast future whereabouts. Here’s how to handle that:

1. **Privacy Controls**

   - Choose fully public, friends-only, or private in one Circle.
   - People who want more control can limit viewers.

2. **Invite-Only Options**

   - Plans can stay hidden from the public.
   - Only invite people you trust with a direct link or something.

3. **Verification Thresholds**

   - Let hosts require verified profiles or a certain rating level.
   - Keeps random or suspicious users out of sensitive plans.

4. **Reporting & Blocking**

   - Quick ways to flag or block anyone suspicious.
   - Fast support response can stop stalking behavior.

5. **Approximate Locations**
   - Show only a rough area if plan is public and not exact time.
   - The exact spot only appears after someone’s approved.

## **Conclusion**

So that’s my quick overview of how I discovered and imagined Buenro’s product journey based on:

- **Casual user interviews** with friends and teammates.
- **Buenro’s actual website** and brand mission about ending loneliness, building real-life community, and bridging co-living with social networking.
- **Group Thinking Psychology**, which can gently encourage even uncertain users to try out co-living, travel buddies, or a home swap.
- **New “Home Swap” Idea**, where homeowners can swap properties when they want to explore each other’s cities, drastically cutting costs and adding a unique community flair.

These insights aren’t necessarily the final word, especially since my sample might differ from your exact user research. But hopefully, it shows **how I think**: by casually talking to friends or peers, extracting their main pain points and desires, and then mapping them to product features in a user-friendly way. I’m super excited about the possibility of contributing to Buenro, because I can see how it can truly help people form deeper connections and find a sense of home anywhere.

Thank you again for taking the time to read through this. I look forward to any thoughts or feedback you might have. If you have any questions or want more details on certain parts, let me know, I’d love to keep the conversation going!
