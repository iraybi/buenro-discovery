# Buenro Home Swap: Case Study

As I'm unable to show the Figma file because I couldn't manage to get permission to share it, I thought why not directly show you how I actually develop a product from the initial concept all the way to execution. As you remember from my previous document, I discovered the idea of **"home swapping"** while discussing Buenro's general concept. So I thought, why not just start working on designing it? This way, you can clearly see my thought process and how I approach design tasks, and it'll also become a nice little case study for me.

## Initial Research

When I searched online, I noticed there are a few services already providing home swapping options. But honestly, they didn't feel very engaging or attractive to me. They seemed a bit basic, and I felt like there was a lot of room to make something better and richer in experience.

So, I treated this as a completely unique idea and started short research by myself. I reached out to a few friends who already rent out their homes on Airbnb. I explained to them how this new swapping feature could be a really good **"win-win"** for homeowners using Buenro. Since they're already comfortable renting their homes, I felt like they were ideal candidates for quick feedback and some early research.

## Findings

### Key insights from the research:

1. **Cost-effective travel:** Most participants liked the idea of swapping because it would allow them to travel cheaply while making use of their own homes.
2. **Trust and safety:** Their main concerns were potential damage and irresponsible guests.
3. **Clear agreements:** Participants wanted explicit agreements about responsibilities like cleaning and damages.
4. **Verified profiles and reviews:** Participants valued verified identities and trustworthy reviews to feel safer.

### Reasons for their interest:

- Frequent travelers saw an opportunity to significantly reduce accommodation costs by finding people traveling regularly in opposite directions.
- Many were attracted by the possibility of affordable travel and experiencing new places without extra accommodation costs.
- The community aspect of home swapping appealed to those interested in making meaningful connections.

## Discovery Methods

Participants identified several ways they would like to discover swappable homes:

- **Direct search:** Searching for homes based on desired locations and dates.
- **Dedicated swap groups:** Surfing through groups specifically created for swapping homes.
- **Posting in groups:** Posting their own swap opportunities and receiving replies from interested homeowners.
- **Casual browsing:** Browsing listings and becoming interested if they find a suitable home for swapping.

## User Concerns

Participants raised the following concerns:

- Difficulty finding common ground from initial posts alone.
- Whether it's possible to negotiate or inquire about details that aren't explicitly listed by the homeowner.

## Proposed User Journey

To address these concerns, I designed a simple user journey with the following features:

- **Discovery:** Users can search homes, engage in dedicated groups, or directly communicate interest through postings.
- **Flexible Communication:** Secure messaging to discuss unlisted details and easily negotiate common interests.
- **Trust Building:** Clearly visible verification badges, authentic photos, and user-generated reviews.
- **Simple Agreements:** Intuitive in-app agreements clearly outlining expectations and responsibilities.
- **Confirmation & Calendar Sync:** Effortless confirmation and automatic integration with calendars.
- **Post-Swap Feedback:** Post-swap ratings and reviews to build ongoing trust within the community.

This proposed journey ensures users feel comfortable swapping homes, provides clarity, and enhances overall convenience.

This mini research and journey mapping gave me a clear path to start the detailed design process.
